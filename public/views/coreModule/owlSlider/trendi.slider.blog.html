            <p>London's Heathrow airport is more than just an international travel hub, it's also a major shopping destination, boasting an impressive directory that ranges from high fashion labels like Burberry, Herm√®s and Gucci, to luxury beauty boutiques such as Chanel and MAC. And with upwards of 200,000 people passing through the terminals each day, Heathrow has a pretty good idea of what's trending with its worldly shoppers.</P>
